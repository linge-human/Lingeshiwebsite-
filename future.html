                        <p>I'm really interested in number theory and geometry, and I'm looking forward to learning more about calculus and non-Euclidean geometry. I enjoy mixing different areas of maths to solve interesting problems and think about things in new ways.</p>
                        <p>I am looking forward to studying more challenging topics in maths in the future.</p>

                        <h3>Science</h3>
                        <p>I'm curious about how plants respond to things like light and gravity. In the future, I'd like to try an experiment where I plant seeds upright and upside down, with lights placed above and below, to see if they grow toward the light or just upward.</p>
                        <p>To support this goal, I applied for the CHES Extended Investigation, where I hope to design and conduct my own research project using ethical methods, critical analysis, and clear communication of findings. It's an opportunity to take my curiosity further and gain real experience in scientific research.</p>

                        <p>I am planning on building a local cloud system using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and USB drives to manage experiment data and code without commercial services. Set up a Python-based server for file sharing and automated backups. This project combines my interests in programming, research support, and developing practical tools for scientific work.</p>

                        <p>I'll keep writing for life - building worlds, exploring ideas, and sharing my work online. Over time, I hope to grow a collection I'm proud of and eventually publish it. Writing is something I'll always come back to.</p>

                        <p>I hope to pursue a future in science - whether as a forensic pathologist, aerospace engineer, genetic engineer or cardiovascular surgeon. What matters most to me is making a difference, even in the smallest ways. I'm driven by both curiosity and purpose. I'll keep learning for the rest of my life.</p>

                        <h3>Vision for the Future</h3>
                        <p>I think boldly when facing global problems - imagining solutions like artificial reefs, orbital solar panels, or bio-inspired megastructures. I draw ideas from nature, real-world systems, and mathematics to shape new ways of thinking in science and engineering. I believe the future can be built not just from steel and gears, but from cells, systems, and life itself.</p>
                        <p>As the film Contact says: "If the universe is only us, it seems like an awful waste of space." Whether or not we are alone, I want to focus on the challenges right in front of us - climate change, planetary engineering, and building a sustainable future using everything science has to offer.</p>
