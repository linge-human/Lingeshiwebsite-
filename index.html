      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm usually the weird kid in the room, you might find me in a coner with a book snug as a bug or being oddly extroverted and yapping to people (this is rarely found to happen). BUT, your lucky to approach this "website"(this is not a website, its a subdomain, I cannot afford to pay for a REAL domain monthly, and wordpress templates piss me off). this is the newest version of the website, and THIS is updated at Sun 19 Oct 2025. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've been around my Github (I suppose you probably havn't?) this website has been updated several times through out the years I've been coding, and i found out that pure HTML works perfecty fine for this. the desing has changed many many times and this will be how it will loo like for the next few years (MAYBE???)... 
      </p>
      <p>
        ...BUT ANYWAYS...
      </p>
      <p>
        I am VERY curiosity driven in my own studies, i often end up wandering toooo deep in to the abbys of science (or any field im interested in). for example, when i was in year 9, i got to know about cells inmore detail, i was really curios about HOW and WHY these happen, it cannot be that each cell has little workers and just DO STUFF? i started looking into the chemistry of cells, and learnt about enzymes, and them like clicking on wikipedia links, i wandered into biochem. i questioned:"where did ensymes come from?" and them learned about amino acids, transcription, and translation in DNA, and learnt about how protiens are formed, and learned about H-bonds...

        and thats how far my little brain could take me.
