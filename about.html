            <h2>Welcome to My Spaceüìñ</h2>
            <p>
                From a young age, I‚Äôve been fascinated by how things work. Not just the mechanics of machines, but 
                the patterns in nature, the logic behind equations, and the way <strong>science and technology shape 
                the world around us</strong>. That curiosity has led me to dive into <strong>automation, AI-driven 
                engineering, mathematics, and design</strong>, always searching for ways to make systems more 
                efficient, more intelligent, and more innovative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, I‚Äôm working on projects that involve <strong>robotics, automation, and mathematical research</strong>, 
                exploring how abstract theories can have real-world applications. Whether it‚Äôs <strong>designing a robotic arm</strong>, 
                modeling <strong>AI-driven problem-solving methods</strong>, or studying the <strong>philosophical and ethical 
                limits of automation</strong>, I believe in learning by doing. Theory is essential, but <strong>application 
                is where real discovery happens</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the technical, I also see creativity as a crucial part of innovation. <strong>Art and design 
                aren‚Äôt separate from science and engineering; they enhance them</strong>. That‚Äôs why I care about aesthetics, 
                user experience, and making sure that whatever I build is not just functional but also 
                <strong>elegant and well-designed</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is a glimpse into my journey‚Äîwhat I‚Äôm learning, what I‚Äôm building, and what I‚Äôm excited about next. 
                If anything here resonates with you, or if you‚Äôre working on something interesting yourself, feel free to reach out. 
                The best ideas often come from collaboration, and I‚Äôm always looking to <strong>connect with like-minded 
                thinkers, creators, and problem-solvers</strong>.

    I haven‚Äôt felt this tired in a long time. My mind is tangled in confusion, tension, and an unrelenting drive to learn. 
    The more I explore, the more I realize how little I truly know. To escape the fear of not knowing, I keep learning‚Äîfalling deeper into 
    a relentless cycle of curiosity and uncertainty.

    To whoever‚Äôs reading this: good luck. Building this website broke my brain more than once. 
    It took me hours just to scale images properly and get animations to behave the way I imagined. Now I understand how difficult this really is.

    I doubt many people will ever read these words‚Äîbut that‚Äôs okay. Even the smallest progress counts. 
    I‚Äôm listening to <em>Staring at the Sun</em> as I write this, and for the first time, I feel genuinely connected to knowledge itself.
    And hey, I finally figured out GitHub‚Äîso there's that.

    Maybe it‚Äôs just the caffeine.  
    Maybe not.
