          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>This project investigates one of the most fundamental yet misunderstood experiments in physics â€” the double-slit experiment â€” and extends it into a practical demonstration of Richard Feynmanâ€™s <em>path integral formulation</em> of quantum mechanics. Rather than viewing light as traveling along a single trajectory, this research tests whether the visible beam is the result of the interference of <strong>all possible photon paths</strong>.</p>
          <p>By systematically increasing the number of slits from one to two hundred, the experiment traces how the classical interference pattern evolves into a sharply defined beam. The goal is to make visible how quantum superposition manifests through constructive and destructive interference, offering a tangible link between abstract theory and experimental observation.The final setup â€” a semi-permeable sheet with 200 fine slits â€” produced a single, bright, focused beam, visually demonstrating the principle that the observed path is the result of the interference of all possible paths, with only the <em>path of least action</em> surviving.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="popup-section">
          <h2>What I Did</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Constructed and stabilized a multi-slit optical system using a 650â€‰nm (Â±10â€‰nm) green laser pointer (0.4â€‰mW) and precision-engineered slit and MoirÃ© grating plates</li>
            <li>Captured diffraction and interference patterns using an iPhone 15 camera aligned orthogonally to the projection screen for high-resolution imaging</li>
            <li>Designed a custom HTML-based light intensity analyzer to process images by extracting red-channel RGB data for fringe detection and quantification</li>
            <li>Applied theoretical relationships such as <em>Î”x = Î»L / d</em> to correlate fringe spacing with slit separation and number of apertures</li>
            <li>Analyzed and graphed the evolution of interference peaks (from 0 to 31 peaks) as slit number increased from 1 to 200</li>
            <li>Interpreted findings using Feynmanâ€™s path integral concept, comparing experimental data with quantum probability amplitude theory</li>
            <li>Presented the work for the 74th <strong>Science Talent Search (STS)</strong> 2025 competition under the experimental design category</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="popup-section">
          <h2>Technical Details</h2>
          <p>The experimental setup involved a laser stabilized on a clamp stand, slit plates fixed perpendicular to the beam using Blu-Tack, and a 1.0â€‰m projection distance to ensure consistency across all trials. Experiments were performed in a fully darkened room to minimize background interference.</p>
          <p>Each pattern was digitally recorded and analyzed using Python-assisted HTML scripts that calculated average fringe intensity, spacing, and peak count. Data was cross-checked against theoretical predictions derived from classical wave interference and Feynmanâ€™s probabilistic model. The results revealed that as slit spacing (<em>d</em>) decreased, fringe spacing (<em>Î”x</em>) also contracted, producing a narrower central maximum and supporting the wave superposition hypothesis.</p>
          <p>Peak intensity was found to scale non-linearly with slit number, influenced by alignment precision and coherence. The 200-slit configuration yielded a near-Gaussian central distribution resembling a single coherent beam â€” an analog to how multiple quantum paths interfere to produce a single observable trajectory.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="popup-section">
          <h2>Results & Outcomes</h2>
          <p>Results demonstrated a progressive narrowing and intensification of the central fringe as the number of slits increased. The double-slit configuration produced seven distinct peaks, while the 20- and 200-slit arrangements produced over 30 and 26 peaks respectively, consistent with predictions from multi-path interference theory.</p>
          <p>This progression validates the hypothesis: a greater number of coherent paths enhances constructive interference, refining the beamâ€™s focus. The experiment thus provides a visual, empirical representation of Feynmanâ€™s claim that particles explore all possible paths and that the observable path emerges from the interference of these probabilities.</p>
          <p>The study successfully bridges classical optics and quantum mechanics, offering a concrete demonstration of a deeply abstract quantum principle â€” showing how the familiar beam of light is not a simple linear event but a product of universal interference across countless potential paths.</p>

          <p><strong>CHEMI</strong> is a web and mobile platform designed to help students master chemistry through interactive calculators, question databases, and practice tools. Built using Claude Code and manual coding methods, the project combines intuitive design, structured data systems, and algorithmic computation to make chemistry concepts accessible and practical.</p>
          <p>The system includes modules for molar mass calculation, balanced equation solving, and a database of past VCE chemistry questions organized by year, topic, and difficulty. Users can log in, save history, adjust themes and text size, and track their learning progress.</p>

            <li>Built dynamic front-end interfaces using Claude Codeâ€™s generation tools combined with manual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript refinement.</li>
            <li>Created and structured multiple interconnected databases for questions, user data, and topic categorization using JSON and cloud storage solutions.</li>

        <section class="popup-section">
          <h2>Technical Details</h2>
          <p>CHEMIâ€™s structure is based on modular design, with distinct sections for <em>calculator tools</em>, <em>question banks</em>, and <em>user interaction systems</em>. The wireframe outlines a layered layout including login/signup, dynamic calculators, searchable question databases, and topic filters for VCE chemistry units (Unit 1â€“4).</p>
          <p>The app logic was built using Claude Code as a scaffold, then expanded through manual scripting. Database functions handle text-based queries, filter selection, and search-by-topic systems (Atomic Structure, Bonding, Stoichiometry, etc.).</p>
          <p>Manual coding was used to connect UI elements with database functions, ensuring accurate retrieval, display, and history tracking for each user session. Future plans include using Python back-end integration for auto-grading and AI question generation.</p>

        <section class="popup-section">
          <h2>Wireframe & System Architecture</h2>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Login / Sign-up</strong> â€” personalized entry with saved progress and account control</li>
            <li><strong>Calculator</strong> â€” chemical formula input, output display, and detailed working steps</li>

            <li><strong>Developer & GitHub Links</strong> â€” transparent access to core JavaScript files</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This structure allows for continuous scalability â€” future modules (like molecular visualization or reaction simulation) can be integrated without breaking existing layouts.</p>

        <section class="popup-section">
          <h2>Current Progress & Future Goals</h2>
          <p>Core modules (calculator, question list, and user interface) are functional. Next steps include implementing database optimization for faster querying, adding cloud-based authentication, and developing visual learning components for molecular structures and energy diagrams.</p>
          <p>The long-term goal is to evolve CHEMI into a hybrid learning environment that combines computational tools, adaptive questioning, and conceptual explanations â€” bridging the gap between theory and problem-solving.</p>
